### Mulitply Polynomial's in O(nlogn) time<br>
Programs allowing user to input coefficient representaions 2 polynomials and recieve coefficent represtation of thier product<br><br>
This is accomplished by:<br>
1) evaluating plolynomials at the appropriate nth roots of unity to obtain a value representation<br>
2) multiplying resulting value representations to obtain value representation of product<br>
3) interpolating the value representation of the product to get its coefficient representation.
